# ARKit Workshop Prep

***MAKE SURE YOU COMPLETE THIS BEFORE THE WORKSHOP***

Hi Everyone,

Thank you for signing up to the workshop! I canâ€™t wait to see you all in just 2 weeks time.

A few of you asked me what you should bring to the workshop and what to prepare. So here it goes.

Things to Bring:

1) Mac laptop
2) iPhone 6S or above or iPad with A9 chip or above
3) USB-to-Lightining cable (apple phone cable)
4) Snacks to share with others ðŸ˜‰

How to Prepare:

1) Make sure you have Xcode up and running with the latest version (currently 9.2)
2) Make sure you have macOS High Sierra
3) Signup for a FREE developer account with Apple https://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/
4) Make sure you can deploy apps to your device by opening xCode and creating a new AR Project
File > New > Project


Select Augmented Reality Project and give it a name as seen below. For the organization identifier, use `com.<your-last-name>` this will ensure you have a unique identifier that doesnâ€™t conflict with existing apps on your device.



Plugin your device via a USB cable (make sure to mark the computer as trusted if asked). With your phone unlocked, press the play button on Xcode. 



If you have done everything correctly, the app should now launch on your phone and ask permission to use your camera. After you grant permissions you should see a plane hovering infront of you.

Congrats! You have already launched your first ARKit app. Time to update that resume/linkedin :).

Note: you might hit issues with signing certificates that you will need to resolve before Xcode will be able to push the code to your device. Typically it just means you havenâ€™t selected your provisioning profile or the profile is not setup correctly. As always, google has all the answers.

Please make sure you get to this stage, it will be our starting point for the workshop and I would like you to learn about AR rather than fight with Xcode deployment process.

Email me if you have any questions michael@nano3labs.com.

See you on January 31st.

Cheers,

Michael Yagudaev
